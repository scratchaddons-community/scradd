# Contributing guidelines

For anyone who knows [Git](https://git-scm.com) and JavaScript basics: feel free to contribute to this repository! Our code is open source. Be sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/shock59/sa-bot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## General Guidelines

Please:

-   Follow [the code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
-   Stay on topic
-   Use reactions instead of meaningless comments, AKA reacting with thumbs-up instead of commenting "Good idea".

## Filing [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

Found a bug? Report it! Be sure to check if it is already reported by using the search bar [here](https://github.com/shock59/sa-bot/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can create a new one. We will take a look at it.

## Starting [discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)

Please:

-   Choose a relevant category.
-   Mark comments that answer your question as to the answer.
-   Only use Discussions for questions, comments, and other related topics. Please do not request new features or report bugs in Discussions; they will be closed and ignored.

## Creating [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Contributions are welcome! Be sure to file an issue first (see above). If you know a fix for that issue, or you know a fix for a different one, you can create a pull request. Fork this repository, create a new branch from the 'main' branch, and make your changes to the new branch. Now, create a pull request on the origin repository (shock59/sa-bot). We will review your pull request.

Please:

-   Fill out the template. Replace all comments (text flanked by `<!--` and `-->`).
-   Minimize lint errors.
-   Write meaningful commit messages, AKA more than one word long.
